Nice and small App from an Electron starter tutorial seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxHQoiDctI&t=21s" target="_blank">here</a>.

Some small changes had to be done though, like adding Notifier package and the notification logic, plus few syntax preferences.

It includes electron-packager to build an app on different OS with these commands :

For Windows : 
<pre>npm run package-win</pre>

For Mac : 
<pre>npm run package-mac</pre>

For Linux : 
<pre>npm run package-linux</pre>
